- No Code Tools for AI Agent : _zapier, n8n 
- with code Agentic AI framework : CrewAI , Langraph 
- In No Code tools we can build Agent within a minutes but the less control over the customization but In coding platform the main advantage is customization.
- In No code tools have fast development, but limited customization, Initial cost is low but as an when the usage increases the cost of the consumption also has increased.
- In other side, the coding platform like CrewAI, Langraph , we can do lost of customization, and we can also minimize the cost and optimize the cost using different ML and SW techniques


### What is Streaming: 
In LLM, streaming means model start sending tokens (words) as soon as they generated, instead of waitin for entire response to be ready before retruning it.

#### Why Streaming:
- faster response time low drop of rate.
- Mimics human like conversation ( build trust, keep alive, and keep user engage).
- Imporant of multi-model uis
- You can cancel mid of the way to save the tokens.
- You can interleaved UI updates, e.g., show "thinking..", show tools result.
