Today I am exploring different models in Gemini space.

- Gemini X Pro : The best LLM model which can understand the multimedia and most powerful agentic and vibe coding mode yet. Delivering richer visuals and deeper interactivity, all build on foundation of state-of-art reasoning.
    - Gemini 3 pro preview : 
        - Input : Text, Image , Audio, Video and PDF. 
        - Output : Text
        - Supported Capabilities : Batch API, Caching, Code execution, File search, function calling, Search grounding, structure output, thinking, URL context
        - Not supported Capabilities : Audio generation, Grounding with Google Maps, Live API, Image generation
    - gemini-x-pro-image-preview :
        - Supported Capabilities: Batch api, Image generation , Search grounding, Thinking, Structured outputs. 
        - Not Supported Capabilities :  Audio generation, Caching, File search, Grounding with Google Maps, Live API, URL context, Function calling, Code Execution, 
    - Gemini 3 Flash : Our most balanced model for speed scale and frontier intelligence.
        - Input : Audio, Video, PDF, Text and Image
        - Output : Text
        - Supported Capabilities : Batch API, caching, code execution, Function calling, Structure output, search grounding, thinking , URL context.
        - Not supported capabilities : Audio generation, Grounding with google maps, Live API, Image generation. 
    - Gemini 2.5 Flash : Our best model in terms of price-performance, offering well-rounded capabilities. 2.5 Flash is best for large scale processing, low-latency, high volume tasks that require thinking, and agentic use cases.

    - Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite : Our fastest flash model optimized for cost-efficiency and high throughput.
    - Gemini 2.5 Pro : Our state-of-the-art thinking model, capable of reasoning over complex problems in code, math, and STEM, as well as analyzing large datasets, codebases, and documents using long context.
